This is a project so that I can learn and practice rust-lang and distributed systems.

## Problem Statement

We are in the hotel business, and expanding fast, so we need to acquire new
locations and integrate them into our business. Each venue come with legacy
systems that are operable, but to streamline our operations, we are integrating
each locations subsystems into our own operations. Our operations consist mainly
of our website handling information like reservations, schedules etc.

For that our website need to:

- [ ] Market each or our locations and their associated services;
- [ ] Place reservations;
- [ ] Sell reservations
  - [ ] for lodging;
  - [ ] for event venues;
  - [ ] for catering;
- [ ] Sell other services to our guests;
  - [ ] Meals on our restaurants;
  - [ ] Laundry for b2b;

All of these need to integrate with legacy systems. They work for now but we
will replace them.
